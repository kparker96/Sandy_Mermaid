This work analyses the abiotic and biotic factors contributing to higher thermal tolerance documented at Mermaid Reef in comparison to the neighboring less heat tolerant Sandy Cay Reef. Temperature, depth, light intensity, and coral composition were analyzed, as well as microsatellite genotyping, quantitative PCR, and 16S rRNA metabarcoding to examine host genotype diversity, Symbiodiniaceae composition, and bacterial communities in O. faveolata colonies at each site. This repository contains all analyses of environmental characterization and Symbiodiniaceae composition from qPCR data conducted as part of this work.
